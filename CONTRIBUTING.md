### I have an idea about making the website better

Is it around a portion of the site we're currently talking about?  Jump in!

Current specific discussions:

* User experience: [`exercism/discussions#34`](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues/34),
- solutions page: [`exercism/discussions#32`](https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues/32),


Here are some helpful starter searches in the two repositories that contain ideas about the website:

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep exercism welcoming. Please read and abide by the [Code of
  Conduct](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## The Ecosystem

Exercism consists of two main parts:

- **the website** - where the conversations happen (this repository)
- **the command-line interface (CLI)** - to fetch exercises and submit solutions [exercism/cli](https://github.com/exercism/cli)

Behind the scenes we also have:

- **language tracks** - one repository per language [see list](https://github.com/exercism/x-api/tree/master/tracks)
- **problem metadata** - a shared repository for all languages [exercism/x-common](https://github.com/exercism/x-common)
- **the problems API** - serves the exercise data [exercism/x-api](https://github.com/exercism/x-api)
- **rikki- the robot** - provides automated feedback on certain exercises [exercism/rikki](https://github.com/exercism/rikki)

### Contributing

We curate issues that we think are good for starting out into [exercism/todo](https://github.com/exercism/todo/labels/start-here).

If you want to work on the exercism.io website codebase, then continue reading this guide.

To contribute to one of the language tracks, check out the [Language Track Guide](https://github.com/exercism/x-common/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

For details about working with the problems API, check out the [Problems API Guide](https://github.com/exercism/x-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Submitting Code Changes

These instructions should get you closer to getting a commit into the
repository.

See the [Setting up Local Development guide](docs/setting-up-local-development.md) for more information about how to run exercism.io locally.

### Git Workflow

1. Fork and clone.
1. Add the upstream exercism.io repository as a new remote to your clone.
   `git remote add upstream https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io.git`
1. Create a new branch
   `git checkout -b name-of-branch`
1. Commit and push as usual on your branch.
1. When you're ready to submit a pull request, rebase your branch onto
   the upstream master so that you can resolve any conflicts:
   `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/master`
   You may need to push with `--force` up to your branch after resolving conflicts.
1. When you've got everything solved, push up to your branch and send the pull request as usual.

### Issues

We keep track of everything around the repository using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues).

### Good First Patch

We're trying to label issues with "good first patch" if we think that these can be solved
without too much context about exercism.io's codebase or functionality. To find them, you
can do an [organization-wide search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+patch%22+user%3Aexercism).

### Labels

[TODO: explain the various labels as we settle on useful ones]

### Style (Ruby)

We have [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) integrated.
It is based on the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).
Help keep us our code clean by following the style guide.
Run the command `rubocop` to check for any style violations before
submitting pull requests.

### Style (JS/CSS)

If you have any JS or CSS changes, please run `cd frontend && lineman spec-ci` to check for any style violations before submitting pull requests.

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, sometimes we'll ask you to make changes before
we accept the patch.

Please do not close the first pull request and open a second one with these
changes. If you push more commits to a branch that you've opened a pull
request for, it automatically updates the pull request. This is also the case
if you change the history (rebase, squash, amend), and use git push --force to
update the branch on your fork. The pull request points to that branch, not to
specific commits.

## Exercism Web Structure

### Intro

Exercism is built with the [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) web framework.
If you haven't heard of it, definitely check it out. It's a lightweight web framework for Ruby.

Exercism seems to follow what some may call an MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture.
Read more about that [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter).

### Core Directories

#### API

API contains routes which are used by the JavaScript frontend and the [CLI](https://github.com/exercism/cli).
The routes here are similar to the one's in `app/` in that they're individual Sinatra apps that inherit from the Core API route (`api/v1/routes/core.rb`).
If you add a route, it needs to be added to `api/v1/routes.rb` and `api/v1/v1.rb`.

#### App (Routes, Presenters, Helpers and Views)

App is the user facing side of Exercism.
It handles logging in (and other functions), making calls out to the database to store or get information,
structuring HTML (that can later be styled), etc.

**Helpers** can be anything that *helps* presentation of data. For Exercism, these are things like:
wrappers for Markdown and Syntax Highlighting parsers, session handling, etc.
Helpers are defined in individual modules under `app/helpers/*`.
The full list of helpers is in `app/helpers.rb`, and if you add a new helper, this file needs to be edited.
The convention is `ClassName: 'filename'`.

**Presenters** are for showing information that would be beneficial to users or the views but maybe not the best way to store data.
For example, in Exercism, most times are stored in UTC (generally most servers store time this way) but... users might want to see times in their own timezone.
Presenters can take relevant information (like showing comment notifications on the dashboard) and transform it to be more personal.
This convention hasn't been strictly enforced so that description varies between presenters.
Presenters are defined in individual classes/modules under `app/presenters/*`.
The presenters are loaded into the app in the `app/presenters.rb` file, and if you add a presenter, it needs to be added to that file.
The convention is `ClassName: 'filename'`.

**Routes** in Sinatra are kind of like a combination of routes and controllers in Rails.
Each route file contains an individual Sinatra app that inherits some behavior from `Core` (found in `app/routes/core.rb`).
In a route file, you can specify endpoints (like `exercism.io/login`) and define how the app should respond (i.e. accept some credentials and log the user in or handle errors accordingly).
Routes are defined in individual modules under `app/routes/*`.
The route files are loaded into the app with the `app/routes.rb` file, and if you add a route file, it needs to be added to that file.
The convention is `ClassName: 'filename'`.
Routes are unique in that you'll also have to update the main `app.rb` with the new app info.
The convention is `Routes::ClassName`.

**Views** are a collection of templates that create html.
Templates are a way to embed Ruby in your views so that you can serve up information,
iterate over items without repeating yourself (like creating tables of data), etc.
The templating engine that Exercism uses is [ERB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERuby).

#### Frontend (JavaScript, Custom Directives, Bootstrap, etc)

The client side is mostly written in CoffeeScript and uses frameworks like angular and bootstrap.

**Frontend** is where Exercism stores all of it's production client side code.
Exercism doesn't have much JS (outside of bootstrap) but `frontend/` does handle comment threads on submissions, markdown preview on comments, submission code (expanding and contracting), etc. If you suspect that there is frontend wizardry happening and you haven't seen it in bootstrap, most likely it's in here.

#### DB (Migrations)

To create a migration you can use `rake db:generate:migration name=the_name_of_your_migration`.
That will create a new migration in `db/migrate`.
For help, look at the other migrations or at docs for ActiveRecord migrations.
If you add, remove or rename database columns, you may have to update the seeds as well.
Exercism pulls seed data from another repo found [here](https://github.com/exercism/seeds).
The seed data provides placeholder information (like users, exercise submissions, comments, etc) to help with development.

#### Lib (DB Configurations, Application Logic, Models, Rake Tasks)

**Application Logic** can be anything that is used for the backend application (and, possibly, shared with the frontend as well) can live here.
Maybe a library for GitHub OAuth, configurations for a Markdown parser and a syntax highlighter, etc.

**Models** are for connecting classes (e.g. `User`) and their attributes to database tables with ActiveRecord (ones that you set up with migrations), relating them to other tables (e.g. `User` `has_many :posts`) and adding other type functionality (e.g. validations).

#### Test

Tests follow the organization of the app. For instance, if you're writing a new route, it would go in `test/app`. You could write a test post or get and assert that you get back data that you expect. Read more about tests [here](#test-order).

### Additional Directories

#### Bin (Tools)

**Console** provides a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) with the Exercism application logic pre-loaded.
Want to see what it would look like to be a user that has done every exercise? Console.
Want to test out a new feature but you haven't written the frontend for it? Console.
A bit more info can be found [here](#console).

**Setup** is a script that you can run in order to create the development and test databases, makes sure all the apps dependencies (gems) are installed, etc.

#### Config

Database connection, bugsnag config and local development GitHub OAuth credentials.

#### Docs (Static Files for GitHub Docs)

Static files and pictures for hosting in the GitHub docs.

#### Public (Static Files for the Site)

Static files for the Exercism web app. Fonts, jQuery (`public/js/app.js`), icons, language images, and sass (styling).

#### X

X is a collection of scripts to organize and compile documentation for the many parts of exercism (cli, general help, product introduction, track info).

## Future Roadmap

We focus our efforts on the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

Sometimes we get suggestions for things that would be great, but they're not
part of locking down the core behavior of the app. In this case we'll close
and label it ["future roadmap"](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/labels/future%20roadmap)
to make it easy to search for later.
